\f0\fs24 \cf0 Sunny is a CS400 student who really loves CS but gets sick a lot. She has to go to the doctor\'92s three times a week to get her problems solved.Last year she thought she\'92d lose hope to college because the transition between high school and college is tough, and she almost did not make it. But this semester, she found her CS400 professor nice and patient and her Xteam teammates friendly and helpful.}
