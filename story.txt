Sunny is a CS400 student who really loves CS but gets sick a lot. She has to go to the doctor’s three times a week to get her problems solved. Last year she thought she’d lose hope to college because the transition between high school and college is tough, and she almost did not make it. But this semester, she found her CS400 professor nice and patient and her Xteam teammates friendly and helpful.

One day Sunny was doing a programming assignment. She thinks her code is right but she cannot pass the final test on GradeScope. She edited some codes but it turns out that more tests failed. Now she regrets not having the previous code saved in some place. She turned to TA for help and TA teached her about Git.

Sunny asked the TA more questions about the assignment, and the TA helped, but Sunny still couldn't get those few last points on GradeScope. She consulted her notes to try to find answers. After tracing through her code a few times, she realized that there were some syntax errors in her code that she could easily fix. Even with these fixes, Sunny could not get full points on GradeScope.
